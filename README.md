# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset from Kaggle. Techniques to handle class imbalance, such as SMOTE and class weighting, were applied. Models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with performance measured using suitable factors.
